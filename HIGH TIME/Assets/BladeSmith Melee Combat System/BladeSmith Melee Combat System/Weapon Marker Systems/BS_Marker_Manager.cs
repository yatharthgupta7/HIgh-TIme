	 [Tooltip("A weapon can work in two ways: Manual and Continuous. Manual bases on an idea that each attack (like a sword swing) can hit each target only once - it then needs to be manualy reloaded through a function call or an Animation Event (for example by ClearTargets() - explained in the Info Bool, at the bottom of this Inspector window). This method is very precise, as you can be certain that each Target will get damage and  Hurt animation (on BS_Main_Health script) triggered only once with each swing. Manual should be used in most situations, mostly for animation-driven combat (like Dark Souls or God of War). The Continuous mode deals damage constantly, in a given time interval, giving you a constant damage-dealing weapon. It's better for VR and games with free-moving weapons (like when the Player can swing his sword by moving his mouse in any desired direction) - the downside of Continuous damage is that it takes away the precise control of the damage dealt (as each Target may be hit more than once depending on how fast the weapon is being driven around). Continuous should be used with blades which can move freely, independent from animations. [INFO:] Continuous damage is not fit for working with shields (BS_Shield script objects).")]
